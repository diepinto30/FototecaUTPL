# [1.0.0](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/compare/@ionic/utils-fs@0.0.7...@ionic/utils-fs@1.0.0) (2019-01-08)


### Bug Fixes

* rimraf is a full dependency ([962ad94](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/commit/962ad94))


### Features

* switch to fs-extra ([c17d8d8](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/commit/c17d8d8))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* `readDir`, `readDirp`, `readDirSafe` were renamed to be
consistent with fs and fs-extra. `readJsonFile` and `writeJsonFile` have
been renamed to `readJson` and `writeJson` and use the fs-extra version
directly. `isDir` was removed (use stat). `copyFile` and `copyDirectory`
were removed (use `copy`). `removeDirectory` was removed (use `remove`).
